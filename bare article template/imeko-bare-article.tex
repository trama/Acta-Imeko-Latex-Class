\begin{abstract}
The editorial team of Acta IMEKO strongly encourages 
authors to use this \LaTeXe template file to produce their manuscript. 
The abstract should be composed in a way suitable for publication 
in the abstract section of electronic journals, 
and should state concisely what it is written in the paper. 
Important items are the aim of the research, the basic method and the major achievement 
(also numerically, when applicable). The length should not exceed 200 words.

\section{Introduction}

The introduction describes the background of the research, a 
short review of related research published in recent literature, 
together with the major claims setting the framework of the 
present publication. References should be related to the present 
publication, not just a list of papers merrily showing the authors'
knowledge of the literature. This relation must be made explicit. 
The newly presented method is shortly introduced, as an 
alternative to previously published methods, with mention of the 
advantages aimed at.

\subsection{Subsections} \label{sec:sub1}

If a section is long or deals with different topics, make a subdivision in subsections. Avoid further subdivision of a subsection. When subsections are used, there must be at least two. Use the style named ``Level2Title'' for the header of a subsection.

\subsection{Numbering of subsections}

Subsection numbering follows the outline numbering format which is configured in the template. Subsection headings use the Calibri font and are in bold.
